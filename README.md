# random_SQL_insert_generator
A C++ program that generates random mysql insert queries based on certain parameters.

This is an upload of a Visual Studio save directory.
If for some incomprehensible reason you would like to check the Source.cpp it is at
random_sql_generator/Source.cpp

If youd just like to grab the executable its at
Debug/random_sql_generator

Enjoy populating your database with ugly test data ;)


*sidenote this is just byproduct of me trying to learn C++ dont take it too seriously*
